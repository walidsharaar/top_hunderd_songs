Write a program to go back in time to find the music that was in the top 100 shots that were being played all over the radio so that you can relive that period
once more through music.
You can use the Billboard website which compiles a list of the top 100 songs. Then use the Spotify API to create a playlist for that particular date  and add
those songs to our new playlist.
